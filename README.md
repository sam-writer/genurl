# genurl

GENerate URLs

This is a sketch of how this should work. Better to use a LM than some random packages. Feel free to open a PR.

## Usage

```sh
$ pip install genurl
>>> installation output
$ genurl 1000 urls.txt
>>> generate 1000 urls in the file urls.txt
```

## Development

Haven't automated yet. `poetry publish --username PYPI_USERNAME --password PYPI_PASS --build`
